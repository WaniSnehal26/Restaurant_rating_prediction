# Restaurant rating prediction case study in python
Zomato, the online food app, has reached out to you to help them to predict how good or bad a restaurant will turn out in the future. So that, they can take a decision to include the restaurant in their app or remove it.
They have shared the data of 9551 restaurants from all over the world which are currently present in the Zomato App. It contains the details about the restaurants and what rating it achieved finally.
Aim- The task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the Rating of a restaurant based on its characteristics.
In below case study I will discuss the step by step approach to create a Machine Learning predictive model in such scenarios.

# The flow of the case study is as below:
1) Reading the data in python
2) Defining the problem statement
3) Identifying the Target variable
4) Looking at the distribution of Target variable
5) Basic Data exploration
6) Feature Engineering
7) Rejecting unnecessary columns
8) Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
9) Feature Selection based on data distribution
10) Outlier treatment
11) Missing Values treatment
12) Visual correlation analysis
13) Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
14) Converting data to numeric for ML
15) Sampling and K-fold cross validation
16) Trying multiple Regression algorithms
17) Selecting the best Model
18) Deploying the best model in production
